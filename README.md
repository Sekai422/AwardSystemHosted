# AwardSystem

To use the award system at its current stage please run the login html file by double clicking the file.
This file will allow you to login to the system and view the other pages. Pages available for viewing include
the forgot password page, which has minimal functionality at the moment, the create an account page where you
can go about creating an account but since the database is not yet set up your account will not be saved.

You can also login using the username "jjrey" and the password "cat". This login will redirect you to 
the main page of our scholarship system which you can also view at this time.
